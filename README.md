**Project Information**
=====================

The purpose of this project was to create file sharing software. The file sharing system will expose a directory of files on 
the server to clients directly. The file sharing clients will connect to a central server, which will respond to a single 
client command, and then disconnect. Each time the client needs to issue another command, it will reconnect before 
sending the command.


**Instructions**
=====================

1. Clone The Repository [here](https://github.com/Abdullahsrwr/groupProject_CSCI2020U).
2. Open the clone folder into a JavaFX applicable IDE.
3. Select and run the src code file named "Server".
4. Select and run the src code files named "client"
